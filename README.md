# Project
My project is called pokedex, which is a search database. This can help those who like pokemon or want to know about pokemons to look up relevant information, such as ID numbers, names, abilities, etc.

"Add Pokemon" button: Add new pokemon to the homepage.
"Clean" button: Remove all the pokemon that user have on the homepage.
"Random" button: Depending on the number of Pokemons, the server will randomly add new pokemons.

"Search box": User can search the desired pokemon with pokemon name and the id number.
